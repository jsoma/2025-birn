Scraping is a powerful way to convert web sites into data files that you can analysis with Sheets, Excel, or even ChatGPT.

## Using Easy Scraper

After you've installed Easy Scraper, you first need to open it by clicking the extensions button.

Then you might need to click "Change List" until the rows look reasonably right. Don't worry if there's extra stuff in there, you can clean it up later.

Are there **multiple pages?** Pick an option from the dropdown.

If there's a "Next" button: you'll pick **Click link to navigate to next page**, then **Select**, then click the "Next" button.

It'll go and go and go and go and go. When you want to be done, click **Stop Scraping**.
